Man, you would think I could follow some instructions and easily get on here. After roughly 5 attempts, I'm finally able to post!

I had some trouble getting Octopress to launch, so I feel it's appropriate to write a little bit about how I got it to load.There are three primary commands once you are blogging;

1. rake new_post["this is the title of the post"]

2. rake generate

3. rake deploy

4. git push origin source
