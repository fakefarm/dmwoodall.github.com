I'm thinking about how I learn. I like to survey what I'm about to get into. I want to make sure it's worth spending the time to win in the proposed arena. I like to walk the perimeter to see what kind of environment I'm dealing with.

A year and a half ago I decided to walk the perimeter. I didn't decide that I would become a computer programmer. I simply decided I would investigate and see what Ruby on Rails was all about. 

I thought that was the outmost line to walk, only to discover that Rails is a framework for Ruby. That bummed me out because I felt I lost my bearings on the topic. 

So I took a break for a while. Then about a year and a half ago, I decided that if Ruby was the outset I woudl start there. Since I didn't know any programming lanugages and heard so many positive things about it, I felt it would be worth trying. 

So far, here's what I've come to know the perimeter to be. Here's an exercise I wish I had known before I started. This is my best guess on a few rankings on each of these, and where I got my lessons;

### Ruby
Size
Complexity
Time to make a first pass
Status 

### Rails
### Regular Expressions
### Terminal
### Text Editor (TextMate)
### Browsers & Inspecting them
### RVM
### Git
### Github
### HTML & HAML
### CSS & SCSS
### Javascript & JQuery & AJAX & CoffeeScript
### Heroku
### Databases
## Front End stuff
### Photoshop
### Illustrator
### Balsamiq
### Dribbble
