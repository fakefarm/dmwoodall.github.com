A turning point for me in learning to read code was in realizing that reading code is different than reading English. 

The English Language is designed to read left to right, and top down. You should be able to comprehend the page simply by following along, one letter at a time. 

Working with a computer, though is multi-dimensional. Code is strung together and not all the pieces are necessarily touching. 

I came to this realization myself, but found a sense of relief when I read it in Chapter 41 of [Learn Ruby the Hard Way]("#")

After decades of programming I donâ€™t even think about these three ways to read code. I just glance at it and know what it means. I can even glance at a whole screen of code, and all the bugs and errors jump out at me. That took an incredibly long time and quite a bit more study than is sane. To get that way, I learned these three ways of reading most any programming language:
1. Front to back.
2. Back to front.
3. Counter-clock-wise.
Try them out when you have a difficult statement to figure out.
