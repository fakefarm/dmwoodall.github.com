Programming is one of the few, if only, professions that offers a chance to hit a Grand Slam, while simultaneously guaranteeing a single. 

The demand for good programmers is so strong right now, that you'll have no trouble finding employment at a great wage. Further, programming provides you the skills to build your idea into a business if you want to. 

Additionally, few jobs provide such a cool working environment. Great people, cool offices, working on a top of the line computer with Spotify. I can't think of a better way to earn a living.
